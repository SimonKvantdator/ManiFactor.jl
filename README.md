# Approximating maps into manifolds

Approximate functions of type $$\mathbb{R}^m \to M^n$$ where $M^n$ is an $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold manifold.

Depends on `ApproximatingMapsBetweenLinearSpaces.jl`, which is available at TODO.

## Example 1

Approximate $$f \colon [-1, 1]^2 \to S^2,\\ (x, y) \mathrm{stereographic projection}(x^2 - y^2, 2 x y).$$
